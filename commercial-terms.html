      <h1>Commercial Terms</h1>
      <p class="muted">Clear, practical terms for vendors, sponsors and enterprise partners. Our commercial flows are manual and designed to ensure quality and trust.</p>

      <h2>Vendor agreements</h2>
      <p>Vendor agreements outline listing responsibilities, fulfillment expectations and basic quality standards. Agreements are negotiated manually and documented prior to any payment or marketplace activation for the specific vendor relationship.</p>

      <h2>Sponsor agreements</h2>
      <p>Sponsor agreements cover placement, creative assets, and campaign duration. Proposals and pricing are provided after an initial manual review and mutual sign-off.</p>

      <h2>Manual deal approval and pre-payment validation</h2>
      <p>All commercial deals are reviewed by our partnerships team. Pre-payment validation includes identity checks and agreement on terms. Payments are only activated after both parties agree and the commercial approval process is complete.</p>

      <h2>Payments activation</h2>
      <p>Payments are activated after commercial approval. Until then, any financial arrangements are handled offline and confirmed manually. Once payments go live, we'll provide concise guidance for vendors and sponsors on the onboarding steps.</p>
      <p class="muted">Los pagos serán procesados por proveedores externos (Stripe, Google Pay, PayPal) una vez activados.</p>
